## 🚀 Current Status

### Development Server
The development server runs successfully with `pnpm dev` and the site is fully functional locally.

### Build Issue
There's a known build issue with the production build related to a `useRef` error during static generation. This appears to be related to Next.js 15.5.2 and some component interactions.

## 🔧 Quick Fixes for Deployment

### Option 1: Downgrade Next.js (Recommended)
```bash
pnpm remove next
pnpm add next@14.2.0
```

### Option 2: Use Development Build for Now
```bash
# For immediate deployment, use the development build
pnpm dev --port 3000
```

### Option 3: Vercel Deployment
The site can be deployed to Vercel which handles many Next.js issues automatically:

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Deploy with automatic build optimization
